# Note Taker

## Description

My motivation was to build an app were the user could write and save their notes. Now the user will be able to look at the app from anywhere and find their saved notes. While working on this project I learned more about express.js, node.js and backend web development.

## Usage

By pressing the save button your note will be saved on the left and side. Click on it to see it highlighted with text below. Click on the pencil button to start a new note.
